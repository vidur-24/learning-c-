OPERATORS: (same as c lang)

left shift = a<<n ----> a*(2**n)
    ex: 4<<1 = 0100<<1 = 1000
right shift = a>>n ----> a/(2**n)
    ex: 4>>1 = 0100>>1 = 0010

other operators:

    sizeof() = returns the size of variable
    condition?X:Y = ternary operator, returns value of X if cond is true else Y
    cast = convert one data type to another
    comma(,) = causes a sequence of operations to be performed
        note: if a=1,2,3 then the last value will be assigned to a i.e, a=3
    & = reference operator, returns the address of variable
    * = pointer to a variable (dereference operator)
