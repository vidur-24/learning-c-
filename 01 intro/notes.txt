HOW C++ FILES ARE EXECUTED?

    C++ is a compiled language, meaning it needs to be translated into a form the computer can understand before it can run. This translation process happens in multiple steps:

    1. Preprocessing: The preprocessor handles things like removing comments and including header files.  These headers provide definitions and functions for the code to use.

    2. Compiling: The compiler takes the preprocessed code and translates it into assembly language, which is a low-level language specific to the computer's architecture.

    3. Linking (optional): In larger programs, the compiled code (object code) might be spread across multiple files. The linker combines these object files and any necessary libraries (pre-written code) into a single executable file.

    4. Loading and Execution: The executable file is loaded into memory by the operating system. The CPU then fetches and executes the instructions in the program one at a time.


BASIC C++ CODE:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        //code
        cout<<"Hello";
        return 0;
    }

            or

    #include <iostream>

    int main(){
        //code
        std::cout<<"Hello";
        return 0;
    }
